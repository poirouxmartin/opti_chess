# Benchmarks

Machine: AMD Ryzen 9 9900X, Windows 11, MSVC Release (`/Ox /GL /LTCG`), tree
`opti_chess/build/windows-release`. Every binary comes from a `--clean-first` rebuild of
tests + GUI + CLI. Reference perft counts are from
[chessprogramming.org](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Perft_Results), never from the engine.

Commands:

- `opti_chess_cli perft-suite full`: 7 positions, 597 236 237 nodes, copy-make, no bulk counting.
- `opti_chess_cli bench 2000`: 8 positions, 2000 iterations each, `OPTI_SEED=42`; node counts and
  the signature are deterministic (`835175` nodes, signature `8a8961478e14dd47`).
- `scripts/perf_compare.ps1 -A old.exe -B new.exe -Rounds 5`: interleaved A/B runs, medians.

Run-to-run spread on this machine is about +-10 % and the absolute level drifts over a session
(the same binary measured 42 to 57 Mnps in different sessions). Only medians from the same
interleaved A/B session are comparable; numbers from different rows of different sessions are not.

## Baseline (2026-10-13, commit 633f76a)

`perft-suite full`, 3 sequential runs, all 7/7:

| position | depth | nodes | Mnps run 1 / 2 / 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| startpos | 6 | 119 060 324 | 42.07 / 37.29 / 43.06 |
| kiwipete | 5 | 193 690 690 | 36.82 / 40.52 / 40.94 |
| pos3 | 6 | 11 030 083 | 9.67 (outlier) / 28.34 / 27.61 |
| pos4 | 5 | 15 833 292 | 30.17 / 35.72 / 36.70 |
| pos5 | 5 | 89 941 194 | 40.00 / 38.19 / 38.67 |
| pos6 | 5 | 164 075 551 | 37.83 / 37.65 / 38.93 |
| promotion storm | 5 | 3 605 103 | 29.52 / 29.94 / 31.06 |
| **total** | | 597 236 237 | **36.28 / 38.19 / 39.86** |

`bench 2000`: 35 211 / 36 268 / 36 094 nodes/s, signature `8a8961478e14dd47` every run.

## Optimisations (2026-10-13)

Each step: clean rebuild, `scripts/harness.ps1 -NoBuild -Full` (perft-suite full 7/7, gtest
CI set 145/145, UCI smoke, bench signature unchanged), then A/B against the previous step,
5 rounds, median.

| step | commit | change | perft Mnps A -> B | bench nodes/s A -> B | kept |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 9e2ecb4 | perft driver reuses one child `Board` per depth (constructing a Board allocated its history map: one malloc/free per internal node). Perft only, no effect on search | 47.7 -> 56.1 (+18 %) | 37 479 -> 38 049 (noise) | yes |
| B | 9789cec | `get_moves()` reads the piece type from `_array` instead of scanning up to 5 bitboards | 57.3 -> 63.0 (+10 %) | 41 311 -> 39 078 (noise, rounds overlap) | yes |
| C | 0852f15 | constexpr attack tables (knight, king, pawn, empty-board rays + first-blocker bitscan): `get_square_attacker` returns at once when the square is not attacked, `get_pins` skips rays without a matching enemy slider, `get_controls_around_king` builds the enemy attack set with bitboards. Same results, move order untouched | 53.4 -> 59.4 (+11 %) | 36 857 -> 40 289 (+9 %, B ahead in all 5 rounds) | yes |

## Baseline vs final

Same interleaved session, `opti_chess_cli_baseline.exe` (633f76a) vs step C (0852f15), 5 rounds:

| | perft-suite full (Mnps, median) | bench 2000 (nodes/s, median) | perft | bench signature |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 42.05 | 36 313 | 7/7 | 8a8961478e14dd47 |
| final | 57.22 (+36 %) | 38 732 (+7 %) | 7/7 | 8a8961478e14dd47 |

Per round, final ahead of baseline on perft in 5/5 rounds and on bench in 5/5 rounds.
Search speed (bench) gains less than perft because a search node is dominated by the
evaluation, not by move generation.

## Not done / next candidates

- Bulk counting at depth 1 in perft (count `_got_moves` instead of make + recurse): large perft
  gain, but it measures movegen only and does not speed up the search.
- Move generation of the pieces themselves (`add_knight_moves`, `add_rect_moves`,
  `add_diag_moves`) with attack tables: the generation order would change, which changes the
  search (bench signature), so it must go through the NODES-500/2000 McNemar gate.
- Magic bitboards for sliders (currently classical rays with bitscan).
